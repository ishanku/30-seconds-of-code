        "In summary:\n",
        "The model suggests that 'MTenure', 'PedCount', 'ServQual', and 'Comp' are the most important predictors of 'Sales' in this dataset. 'MTenure', 'PedCount', and 'ServQual' have positive relationships with 'Sales', while 'Comp' has a negative relationship. The other variables in the model do not have statistically significant effects on 'Sales' based on these results.\n",
        "Important Notes:\n",
        "Causation: Remember that correlation does not equal causation. These results show associations, but further analysis would be needed to establish causal relationships.\n",

        "Assumptions: OLS regression has assumptions (linearity, independence of errors, etc.). Does these assumptions are met for the validity of the results ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Context: Interpretation of the results in the context of specific business or research question can impact. The practical significance of the coefficients is important to consider alongside statistical significance."
